This is my first JavaScript project for the odin project.

This will start as a console game for now. I will hard code it for the console but will try to then decouple it so that a different user interface will be easy to implement. The instructions say that we will revisit this project to implement a GUI.

I updated the code to be less coupled from the original trash I wrote. I will revisit that again in the context to making a GUI.
