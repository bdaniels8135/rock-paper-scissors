This is my first JavaScript project for the odin project.

It started as a pure browser console game and was quite horribly written code. Since then, it has been developed twice: once to improve the underlying code structure and a second time to add a UI.

In this project, I learned a great deal:
 - interact with the browser console
 - make functions and basic objects in javascript
 - interact with the DOM via javascript
 - generate "random" choice in javascript
 - produce an adaptive layout using flexbox
 - view pages as mobile using chrome developers tools

Ideas for future development:
 - enhance the look of the UI in various ways
 - generate an optional text log of the game in the console
 - add option to expand to rock paper scissors lizard spock
 - allow the player to give their name
 - add options to change the number of rounds
 - generate a message with context for winning or losing a round
    e.g. Rock crushes scissors.
 - make a two player version that can be passed between players
