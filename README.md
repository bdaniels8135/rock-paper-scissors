This is my first JavaScript project for the odin project.

This will start as a console game for now. I will hard code it for the console but will try to then decouple it so that a different user interface will be easy to implement. The instructions say that we will revisit this project to implement a GUI.

This code is truly trash at the moment. Everything is so coupled. All the functions do too much. I am not familiar enough with JS yet to fix it. At least it works!
